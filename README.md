# Etch-a-Sketch
An Etch-a-Sketch to show off my DOM Skills. A tool where you hover your mouse over a grid , when the mouse passes over a grid square it changes to the desired colour. 

The mouse "pen" starts off as a black and can be changed so that random colours are used to fill the grid square, there is also an eraser. 

You are able to completely clear the grid or you can also change the size of the grid.
